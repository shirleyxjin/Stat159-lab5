User A: Shirley Jin
User B: Xiaoqian Zhu

Task 1
User A and B are working on a project together. User A creates a remote connection; user B is able to clone the repo using `git pull` in terminal. User A and B then alternate between changing of files. In order to collaborate, user A/B need to push their changes and pull changes already happened before making further changes.

Task 2
Yes, there's a conflict due to not complete push/pull process. User A needs to push changes, and user B needs to pull changes before B can start making new edits.

Task 3
User B now is working in the task3B branch, when B makes changes in that branch, after committing the changes, B must move to master and merge the changes by 'git merge task3B'.

Task 4
User A and B are now working in different branches on different files, A needs to first merge to their master repo of the changes, push changes, and B needs to pull changes, and then repeat the same process. 

Task 5
There is a conflict since the two users are working on the same file in different branches without push/pull the other user's changes. One user needs to first push changes, the other then pulls changes and is able to avoid conflict and push their changes.
